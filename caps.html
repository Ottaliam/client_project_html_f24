                and take positive pathways to mental health.

            <p>

            <h3>Note</h3>
            <p>
                CAPS has a limited number of <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/article/private-counseling-rooms">private spaces</a> available
                for students to connect with their counselor via telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for
                more information on those private spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews and/or projects.
                Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our 
                <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/article/annual-reports">annual reports</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the confidentiality
                of our clients. However, you are welcome to direct students to the wellness zone, which has a separate
                entrance adjacent to CAPS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the CAPS office.
